faq:
  - question: "Where can I buy Asian sunscreens in the U.S?"
    answer: "Trusted specialty retailers (like Yami), direct brand stores, and selected marketplaces — but always choose sellers that disclose sourcing and offer U.S. shipping."
  - question: "Are Asian sunscreens legal in the U.S?"
    answer: "Yes. Import for personal use is allowed; some UV filters are not FDA-approved for U.S. manufacturing, so check ingredient lists if you have concerns."
  - question: "Will I be charged duties/taxes?"
    answer: "Orders shipped from U.S. warehouses typically do not incur customs duties. For international shipments, duties depend on the declared value and carrier — check the seller's shipping policy."
